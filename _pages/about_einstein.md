I am a Junior attending UIUC School of Information Sciences in Fall 2024. As a former military interpreter with practical experience in cross-cultural communication, data science, and leadership, I thrive on collaboration and teamwork. Currently seeking internship opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. My diverse background allows me to bring a unique perspective to the table, encouraging creativity and driving results.
